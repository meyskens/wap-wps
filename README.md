WAP-WSP
=======

WAP-WSP is a [Wireless Session Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Session_Protocol) server. WSP was an early protocol in WAP (["the baby internet"[(https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=36m14s)]) that acts as a proxy between HTTP/1.1 and made it lightweight to send over GPRS or dial-up over UDP if IP connected (early versions were not). 
Old phones with WAP support (Nokia 3510i in my case) can not work without these, but most mobile carriers have shut these servers down, this is why I implemented my own to get old phones back on the internet!

*The server is currently WIP, and will probably never support the full protocol but just enough to get WAP working again*
